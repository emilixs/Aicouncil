# API Configuration
# Note: All environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client
# In development, the /api proxy in vite.config.ts will forward requests to the backend

# Base URL for REST API calls
# For local development, use /api to leverage the Vite proxy and avoid CORS issues
# For production deployments, set this to the full backend URL (e.g., https://api.example.com)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api

# WebSocket server URL
VITE_WS_URL=http://localhost:3000
